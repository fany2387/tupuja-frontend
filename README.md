# TuPuja.com Angular2

TuPuja.com Angular 2 starter project based on NPM, TypeScript, and Webpack.
Used to show how to set up a project build workflow from scratch.

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code in the `src` folder into ES5 code into the `app` folder.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

Note: We should keep:

node_modules
dist

out of the index, these are the files created by npm
